Options
*******

"--db-instance-identifier" (string)

   The DB instance identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase
   string.

   Constraints:

   * Must be the identifier for an existing DB instance

   * Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

   * First character must be a letter

   * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

"--allocated-storage" (integer)

   The new storage capacity of the RDS instance. Changing this
   parameter does not result in an outage and the change is applied
   during the next maintenance window unless the "--apply-immediately"
   parameter is set to "true" for this request.

   **MySQL**

   Default: Uses existing setting

   Valid Values: 5-1024

   Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the
   current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the
   existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the
   current value.

   Type: Integer

   **Oracle**

   Default: Uses existing setting

   Valid Values: 10-1024

   Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the
   current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the
   existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the
   current value.

   **SQL Server**

   Cannot be modified.

   If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard
   storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS
   to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration
   of the migration depends on several factors such as database load,
   storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount
   of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage
   operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the
   process can take up to several days in some cases. During the
   migration, the DB instance will be available for use, but may
   experience performance degradation. While the migration takes
   place, nightly backups for the instance will be suspended. No other
   Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including
   modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the
   instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a
   DB snapshot of the instance.

"--db-instance-class" (string)

   The new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance. To
   determine the instance classes that are available for a particular
   DB engine, use the  describe-orderable-db-instance-options action.

   Passing a value for this parameter causes an outage during the
   change and is applied during the next maintenance window, unless
   the "--apply-immediately" parameter is specified as "true" for this
   request.

   Default: Uses existing setting

   Valid Values: "db.t1.micro | db.m1.small | db.m1.medium |
   db.m1.large | db.m1.xlarge | db.m2.xlarge | db.m2.2xlarge |
   db.m2.4xlarge"

"--db-security-groups" (list)

   A list of DB security groups to authorize on this DB instance.
   Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change
   is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

   Constraints:

   * Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters

   * First character must be a letter

   * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

Syntax:

   "string" "string" ...

"--vpc-security-group-ids" (list)

   A list of EC2 VPC security groups to authorize on this DB instance.
   This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

   Constraints:

   * Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters

   * First character must be a letter

   * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

Syntax:

   "string" "string" ...

"--apply-immediately" | "--no-apply-immediately" (boolean)

   Specifies whether or not the modifications in this request and any
   pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as
   possible, regardless of the "--preferred-maintenance-window"
   setting for the DB instance.

   If this parameter is passed as "false" , changes to the DB instance
   are applied on the next call to  reboot-db-instance , the next
   maintenance reboot, or the next failure reboot, whichever occurs
   first. See each parameter to determine when a change is applied.

   Default: "false"

"--master-user-password" (string)

   The new password for the DB instance master user. Can be any
   printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".

   Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change
   is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of
   the request and the completion of the request, the "--master-user-
   password" element exists in the "PendingModifiedValues" element of
   the operation response.

   Default: Uses existing setting

   Constraints: Must be 8 to 41 alphanumeric characters (MySQL), 8 to
   30 alphanumeric characters (Oracle), or 8 to 128 alphanumeric
   characters (SQL Server).

   Note: Amazon RDS API actions never return the password, so this action
     provides a way to regain access to a master instance user if the
     password is lost.

"--db-parameter-group-name" (string)

   The name of the DB parameter group to apply to this DB instance.
   Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change
   is applied during the next maintenance window unless the "--apply-
   immediately" parameter is set to "true" for this request.

   Default: Uses existing setting

   Constraints: The DB parameter group must be in the same DB
   parameter group family as this DB instance.

"--backup-retention-period" (integer)

   The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this
   parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this
   parameter to 0 disables automated backups.

   Changing this parameter can result in an outage if you change from
   0 to a non-zero value or from a non-zero value to 0. These changes
   are applied during the next maintenance window unless the "--apply-
   immediately" parameter is set to "true" for this request. If you
   change the parameter from one non-zero value to another non-zero
   value, the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

   Default: Uses existing setting

   Constraints:

   * Must be a value from 0 to 35

   * Can be specified for a read replica only if the source is running
     MySQL 5.6

   * Cannot be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to read
     replicas

"--preferred-backup-window" (string)

   The daily time range during which automated backups are created if
   automated backups are enabled, as determined by the "--backup-
   retention-period" . Changing this parameter does not result in an
   outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as
   possible.

   Constraints:

   * Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi

   * Times should be Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)

   * Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window

   * Must be at least 30 minutes

"--preferred-maintenance-window" (string)

   The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can
   occur, which may result in an outage. Changing this parameter does
   not result in an outage, except in the following situation, and the
   change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are
   pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is
   changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter
   will cause a reboot of the DB instance. If moving this window to
   the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the
   current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are
   applied.

   Default: Uses existing setting

   Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

   Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

   Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes

"--multi-az" | "--no-multi-az" (boolean)

   Specifies if the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing
   this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is
   applied during the next maintenance window unless the "--apply-
   immediately" parameter is set to "true" for this request.

   Constraints: Cannot be specified if the DB instance is a read
   replica.

"--engine-version" (string)

   The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing
   this parameter results in an outage and the change is applied
   during the next maintenance window unless the "--apply-immediately"
   parameter is set to "true" for this request.

   For major version upgrades, if a non-default DB parameter group is
   currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter
   group family for the new engine version must be specified. The new
   DB parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group
   family.

   Example: "5.1.42"

"--allow-major-version-upgrade" | "--no-allow-major-version-upgrade"
(boolean)

   Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this
   parameter does not result in an outage and the change is
   asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

   Constraints: This parameter must be set to true when specifying a
   value for the --engine-version parameter that is a different major
   version than the DB instance's current version.

"--auto-minor-version-upgrade" | "--no-auto-minor-version-upgrade"
(boolean)

   Indicates that minor version upgrades will be applied automatically
   to the DB instance during the maintenance window. Changing this
   parameter does not result in an outage except in the following case
   and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. An
   outage will result if this parameter is set to "true" during the
   maintenance window, and a newer minor version is available, and RDS
   has enabled auto patching for that engine version.

"--iops" (integer)

   The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the
   RDS instance. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage
   and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless
   the "--apply-immediately" parameter is set to "true" for this
   request.

   Default: Uses existing setting

   Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the
   current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the
   existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the
   current value.

   Type: Integer

   If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard
   storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS
   to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration
   of the migration depends on several factors such as database load,
   storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount
   of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage
   operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the
   process can take up to several days in some cases. During the
   migration, the DB instance will be available for use, but may
   experience performance degradation. While the migration takes
   place, nightly backups for the instance will be suspended. No other
   Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including
   modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the
   instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a
   DB snapshot of the instance.

"--option-group-name" (string)

   Indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the
   specified option group. Changing this parameter does not result in
   an outage except in the following case and the change is applied
   during the next maintenance window unless the "--apply-immediately"
   parameter is set to "true" for this request. If the parameter
   change results in an option group that enables OEM, this change can
   cause a brief (sub-second) period during which new connections are
   rejected but existing connections are not interrupted.

      Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced
      Security TDE, cannot be removed from an option group, and that
      option group cannot be removed from a DB instance once it is
      associated with a DB instance

"--new-db-instance-identifier" (string)

   The new DB instance identifier for the DB instance when renaming a
   DB Instance. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

   Constraints:

   * Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

   * First character must be a letter

   * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

      * **VPC:** false

      If no DB subnet group has been specified as part of the request
      and the PubliclyAccessible value has not been set, the DB
      instance will be publicly accessible. If a specific DB subnet
